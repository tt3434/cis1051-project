# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Reminder App

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that allows users to set reminders for themselves and the message they typed will pop up at the time they set it as.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

User is prompted with a message to enter if they would like to have a certain time or time interval from now set for the reminder. Then they are prompted with another message to enter what message they would like to save for their new reminder. The type of time for reminder is set and the message is stored. When the time of the reminder set is valid the message displays and the stored data is deleted. An additional feature is users can view what future reminders that have set and delete them if they choose to.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-User's specific time or time interval is stored.
-User's message is stored.
-Reminder displays correctly at valid time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-User's specific time or time interval is stored.
-User's message is stored.
-Reminder displays correctly at valid time.
-User can view future reminders and delete them if they want.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-User's specific time or time interval is stored.
-User's message is stored.
-Reminder displays correctly at valid time.
-User can view future reminders and delete them if they want.
-Creating a website or app to make the reminder program look better visuality and easier for the user's experience.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need learn about functions that you can make with import time and how they work. How to have my user's input data stored properly and how to delete selected stored data. So information on dictionaries and keys. If I make a app I would have to learn how to setup the user interface and intergerate my program with it. If I create a website, I would need to know some basic html and how to add in my program.
